# melonDS Android port
This is a WIP Android frontend for the melonDS Android port. For the Android port of the emulator, check out https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android-lib

# What is working
*  Device scanning for ROMS
*  Games can boot and run
*  Touch input
*  Game saves (I think)

# What is missing
*  Hardware input
*  Sound (must find the correct settings)
*  Save states
*  Settings

# Performance
Performance is currently terrible and not suitable for use. Right now, this is more of a proof of concept that anything else. But at least we now know that it (kinda) works.

# Building
1.  Clone the project, including submodules with:
    
    `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android.git`
2.  Open the project in Android Studio.
3.  Hit Run
